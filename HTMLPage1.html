        <h2>Who dat?</h2>
        <p>Hey! Didn't see you there *shrugs* Sorry I was too busy trying to figure out how to write this all up, and now here I am trying to figure what to put in here. 
        Who am i? Qreat question, One I ask myself often to be honest. I can start with my name: Tyler or 'Ty' for short. 
        I was born in Kirkland at Evergreen Hospital on the evening of December 12th, 1996. I was then raised in the City of Monroe just North-East of the Seattle Area.
        I have always been a 'creative' or artistic person; starting with drawing and paint, then poetry and some light computer 'coding' with html in Middle School.
        Starting Highschool I got into 'Computer Programming' an introductory class, as well as graphic design and production. This would later turn into AP/Comp Sci. & 
        AP/Graphics and Production.</p>
        <p>
            I never graduated from High School officially due to family/personal reasons, and went right into working. Fast was the name and food was the game from Sixteen years
            old all the way up to about Twenty-One. I then had also spent some time in between food jobs working on cars, and even making/selling house paint at Benjamin Moore.
            I decided to pursue something I did as a hobby, weight lifting: and became a Certified Personal Trainer. While I was an exceptional trainer, shown through clients
            obtaining wonderful results, I realized I just enjoyed the science behind lifting for my own benefits. I was then approached by a cousin who ran his own Landscaping business
            and was convinced to start my own, as it would be a good insight to my "entrepreneurial side" as he called it. I realized I did love the freedom of working for myself, so to speak.
            I supplemented income while building my lawn and yard care service by bartending at nights in Downtown Bellevue, then later managing a bar in Central Bellevue.

        <p>
            After years of bouncing around, and my Father needing a helper as a worker in Auto Body, I pivoted once again. Cancelling my business and going back to working for someone
            else was not enjoyable, to say the least. Flash forward to COVID-19 and our shop shuts down. My best friend who moved a year ago to Utah called me and told me I could
            come work with him at his shop in the Utah Valley, two days of packing and sixteen hours of driving later: I landed in Utah March 18th of this year. Well six weeks into a great
            display of teamwork, moving more cars with my best-friend than I ever did with my father, COVID struck down there. I spent the following weeks on unemployment, playing video games, exercising, and eventually downloading Visual Studio for the 10th time over Eight or so years.
            After boredom peaked during about the fourth week of unemployment, I started up another yard care service for extra money. I began to realize within days I was more excited about getting home
            and working on an UDEMY web dev course more than I was to go run my own business everyday. That began the serious consideration of pursuing becoming a software engineer, or atleast web developer. 
            It didn't take much time to find the newest and greatest stats behind the industry, and jobs therein. Ironically, not the next night did a friend of mine whos thirty ask what I wanted to
            do in life, and told me I gave them the 'total coder vibes' they see in their team they run at Adobe. I then began looking into bootcamps, and here I am - two weeks, a couple hundred lines of code, four exercises and one
            website later - submitting my application for General Assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I didn't touch much on who I am outside of working, it was very intentional. I could go on for hours about my passion for motorcycles and cars.
            My first motorcycle was handed to me in buckets of parts, and I figured out how to put that together. I was homeless at eighteen and overcame that. I've dealt with friends who were suicidal,
            addicts, etc. I went from being severely underweight my whole life to having over 100lbs of pure muscle mass. I have lived an amazing life, full of many many pains and struggles.
            However I feel these things only deserve an after thought, as while they prove to my versatile probem solving, and perseverance: they are not who I am. Who I am is the vision I am currently pursuing,
            and making my reality. The reality I am building right now is one where I can provide something for myself, and siblings, that has never been in our lives; Stability. A secure (in theory)
            job, where during something like a Pandemic, I can work remotely instead of hoping I am eligible for unemployment. I am doing something I have naturally gravitated towards when im bored, or feeling crafty.
            I am here to do something that challenges me, and brings me both pride and fullfilment. I am here to become an Engineer.
